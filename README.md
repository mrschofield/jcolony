# jcolony
A Game of Life simulator written in Java using Swing.

This project was originally written in 2005 as part of a TAFE assignment; after finding the code lying around i thought it would be interesting to revive and improve.

## Building

You need gradle and a java SDK. 
On Windows you can use [SCOOP](https://scoop.sh/) to install both.

To build:
```
gradle build
```

To run:
```
java -jar build\libs\jcolony-1.0.jar
```
